# Smart Loan Recovery System

## Overview
The **Smart Loan Recovery System** is a data science project developed to optimize loan recovery for a financial institution facing challenges with delinquent loans. By leveraging historical borrower data, the project segments borrowers, assigns tailored recovery strategies, and implements an early warning system to maximize recovery rates while minimizing costs. The solution uses Python-based data analysis and predictive modeling to address loan delinquency effectively.

## Objectives
1. **Segment Borrowers**: Categorize borrowers based on attributes like loan amount, monthly income, payment history, and missed payments.
2. **Optimize Collection Methods**: Recommend effective recovery methods (e.g., legal action, settlement offers, calls, debt collectors) to increase recovery rates.
3. **Minimize Costs**: Balance recovery costs with amounts recovered for cost-effective strategies.
4. **Early Warning System**: Identify borrowers at high risk of default for proactive intervention.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset (`loan-recovery.csv`) with the following key features:
- **Borrower Attributes**: `Borrower_ID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Employment_Type`, `Monthly_Income`, `Num_Dependents`.
- **Loan Details**: `Loan_ID`, `Loan_Amount`, `Loan_Tenure`, `Interest_Rate`, `Collateral_Value`, `Outstanding_Loan_Amount`, `Monthly_EMI`.
- **Payment Behavior**: `Payment_History` (On-Time/Delayed), `Num_Missed_Payments`, `Days_Past_Due`, `Risk_Score`, `Predicted_High_Risk`.
- **Recovery Outcomes**: `Recovery_Status` (Fully/Partially Recovered), `Collection_Method`, `Collection_Attempts`, `Legal_Action_Taken`, `Recovery_Strategy`.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Loaded dataset using `pandas` and visualized with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Analyzed borrower profiles and loan attributes to understand delinquency patterns.
2. **Borrower Segmentation**:
   - Created segments (e.g., 'High Income, Low Default Risk', 'Moderate Income, High Loan Burden') using clustering or rule-based methods based on `Monthly_Income`, `Loan_Amount`, and `Risk_Score`.
3. **Recovery Strategy Assignment**:
   - Developed a function to assign strategies based on `Risk_Score`:
     - **High Risk (>0.75)**: Immediate legal action.
     - **Moderate Risk (0.50â€“0.75)**: Settlement offers and repayment plans.
     - **Low Risk (<0.50)**: Automated reminders and monitoring.
   - Applied strategies to a test dataset for personalized recovery plans.
4. **Early Warning System**:
   - Utilized `Predicted_High_Risk` and `Risk_Score` to flag high-risk borrowers, likely using a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression).
5. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Prioritized low-cost methods (e.g., automated reminders) for low-risk borrowers and reserved high-cost methods (e.g., legal action) for high-risk cases.

## Results
- **Segmentation**: Successfully categorized borrowers into distinct risk-based segments.
- **Recovery Strategies**: Tailored strategies improved recovery efficiency, with low-risk borrowers responding to automated reminders and high-risk borrowers targeted for legal action.
- **Early Warning System**: Flagged high-risk borrowers, enabling proactive measures to reduce defaults.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced operational costs by prioritizing low-cost methods for low-risk segments.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-loan-recovery-system.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `Smart_Loan_Recovery_System.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Ensure `loan-recovery.csv` is in the project directory.
   - Execute cells to load data, analyze, and apply recovery strategies.
4. **Environment**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Future Improvements
- Implement advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for predicting recovery outcomes.
- Quantify recovery costs for each method and optimize using cost-benefit analysis.
- Add visualizations (e.g., recovery rate by method) for stakeholder insights.
- Incorporate dynamic risk thresholds to adapt to changing borrower behavior.
